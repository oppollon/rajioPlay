# rajioPlay (ラジオ)
a little internet radio player in the windows taskbar / notification tray

## intro
I made this program for myself (private use) using [BASS.NET](http://www.bass.radio42.com/) which I believe is a freeware and not open-source! This program however is open-source.
I haven't added the feature to add own radios (but will soon!). I made this programm since I couldn't find any other program which just plays internet radios only whitout unnecessary features.

## requirements
- .NET Framework 4.5+ (I use 7.2)

## already added features
- [x] play internet radios
- [x] show current song (as notification)
- [x] add current song to a "likes.txt" file
- [x] copy current song to clipboard
- [x] search current song (with DuckDuckGo or YouTube)

## upcoming features (currently working on)
- [ ] add own radios
- [ ] add own search engines
